This page is powered by [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It uses [html5shiv](http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/) so IE plays along with HTML5 nicely. It provides you a fast and easy way to check if everything aligns by including [#grid](http://www.hashgrid.com/) by default. (Hold 'G' to see the grid, press 'H' to hold the Grid, and 'J' to cycle through the grids!) It uses Jacques Fortiers [`postmore.rb`](http://www.jacquesf.com/2011/03/creating-excerpts-in-jekyll-with-wordpress-style-more-html-comments/)-plugin.

It was crafted by [Florian "bobschi" Holzner](http://lebobs.ch bobschi's Blog). You can find him on [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/bobschi/) and [github](https://github.com/bobschi).
