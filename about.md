This page is powered by [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), is valid [HTML5](http://todo.com/) and <a href="#">CSS3</a> and uses <a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/">html5shiv</a> so IE plays along nicely. It provides you a fast and easy way to check if everything aligns nicely by including <a href="http://www.hashgrid.com/">#grid</a> by default. (Hold 'G' to see the grid, press 'H' to hold the Grid, and 'J' to cycle through the grids!) And it's already awesome! It uses Jacques Fortiers `<a href="http://www.jacquesf.com/2011/03/creating-excerpts-in-jekyll-with-wordpress-style-more-html-comments/">postmore.rb</a>`-plugin.
